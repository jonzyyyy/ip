Yapper is a lightweight and intuitive list-tracking application designed to help users stay organised. Whether you need to manage tasks, events, or deadlines, 
Yapper provides a simple yet powerful way to track your items efficiently.

## Adding tasks

// Describe the action and its outcome.
Yapper provides functionality for 3 types of tasks:
1. `todo`: This command adds a basic task to your list.  
    * Format: `todo {taskname}`
2. `deadline`: This command adds a task with a deadline.
    * Format: `deadline {deadline name} /by YYYY/MM/DD.` 
3. `event`: This command adds a task with a start and end time.
    * Format: `event (event name) /from YYYY/MM/DD HHMM /to YYYY/MM/DD HHMM`
    * Note: HHMM is in 24-hr format (e.g. 1559)


Example: `event Annual Meeting /from 2025/02/01 1500 /to 2025/02/01 1700`
